- 👋 Hi, I’m @gianzellweger
- 👀 I’m interested in compiled languanges and building easy to understand and versatile software with them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some compiled languages including rust, go, swift and probably more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to contribute to projects of moderate size written in a compiled language. The project shouldn't just be many small things written in different languages.
- 📫 gian.zellweger@ict-scouts.ch
